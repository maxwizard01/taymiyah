const passage1 =`<pre>SECTION A: ENGLISH LANGUAGE
Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow:
When we think of birds, we think mainly of small flying creatures with feathers. However, there are many types of birds,
large and small; and not all birds actually fly. 
The smallest bird, the Humming birds, weighs less than a kilogramme, while the largest is the Ostrich 
which is as tall as eight feet and weighs more than 140 kilograrmmes. 

Many centuries ago, there were birds which weighed more than the Ostrich. These birds no longer exist. 
Among them was Moa which was about 4 meters tall and most probably weighted up to 240 kilogrammes. There was even another type of bird 
called the Elephant bird which weighted probably as much as 500 kilogrammes. This type truly merits the name elephant bird.
 Most of the big birds cannot fly. The Ostrich, for instance cannot fly, but it can run as fast as 56 kilometers an hour.

All the birds, however, are provided with various facilities suitable to their environment so that each may look for its own food 
in a way most suitable to its surroundings. For example, those like the Flamingo, which eat small fish, frogs and other 
forms of water life have bills like daggers of spears.
